# rogulike-tutorial
My go at "The Terrible Programmer"'s (AKA Micheal Coates) roguelike tutorial using pygame and the dorian library.

The intention here is to put into practice some of the things I learned in CS50x, submit a version of this program as my final project for CS50x, get the experience of taking a project from beginning to end, begin to flesh out a portfolio, learn Git and Github and, make a fun little game.

I follow Michael's tutorial fairly close, but make thing my own rather quickly. As of writing this read-me, I have added some different enemies and changed the main char to a fighter from a python.

My first entry (push? i dont know the terminology yet) into this repository represents about about 4 months in CS50x including a  month of work plugging away at the python roguelike tutorial. The first entry leaves off at about episode 40.

A huge thanks to Michael Coates for his tutorial! Your a wonderfully generous man to take the time to teach strangers for nothing.
